# Simulation scenarios with HMM

A **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** is a statistical model used to represent systems that transition between different states, where the states themselves are not directly observable. 
Instead, you can infer them based on observable outputs. 
HMMs are widely used in fields like speech recognition, bioinformatics, and signal processing.
